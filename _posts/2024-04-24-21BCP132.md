# Setting Up a Three-Tier Application with Docker

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will create a three-tier application using Docker. A three-tier architecture consists of presentation, application, and database tiers, each running on separate containers. We will build a simple web application where the presentation tier serves a webpage with information fetched from the application tier, which in turn interacts with a database tier.

### Technologies Used:
- Docker
- Flask (for the application tier)
- SQLite (for the database tier)
- HTML/CSS (for the presentation tier)

## Part 1: Setting Up the Presentation Tier

### Step 1: Create the Dockerfile for the Presentation Tier

Dockerfile
# Use an existing base image
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy custom configuration file
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Copy frontend files to the appropriate directory
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/
COPY style.css /usr/share/nginx/html/


#### Explanation:
- FROM nginx:alpine: Pulls the official Nginx image based on Alpine Linux.
- COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf: Copies a custom Nginx configuration file (if needed).
- COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/: Copies the HTML file for the webpage.
- COPY style.css /usr/share/nginx/html/: Copies the CSS file for styling.

### Step 2: Create HTML and CSS files for the Presentation Tier

Create an index.html file and a style.css file for the webpage.

### Step 3: Build the Docker Image

bash
docker build -t presentation-tier:roll_number .


Replace roll_number with your actual roll number.

### Step 4: Run the Docker Container

bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name presentation-tier presentation-tier:roll_number


## Part 2: Setting Up the Application Tier

### Step 1: Create the Dockerfile for the Application Tier

Dockerfile
# Use an existing base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy application files
COPY app.py .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 5000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]


#### Explanation:
- FROM python:3.9-slim: Uses the official Python image with a slim version.
- WORKDIR /app: Sets the working directory inside the container.
- COPY requirements.txt .: Copies the requirements file.
- RUN pip install -r requirements.txt: Installs dependencies.
- COPY app.py .: Copies the application code.
- EXPOSE 5000: Exposes port 5000 where the Flask app will run.
- CMD ["python", "app.py"]: Specifies the command to run the application.

### Step 2: Create the Flask Application

Create a Python file named app.py containing the Flask application code.

### Step 3: Create a Requirements File

Create a file named requirements.txt listing the Python dependencies needed for the application.

### Step 4: Build the Docker Image

bash
docker build -t application-tier:roll_number .


### Step 5: Run the Docker Container

bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name application-tier application-tier:roll_number


## Part 3: Setting Up the Database Tier

For the database tier, we will use SQLite, which does not require a separate container as it can be managed within the application container.

### Step 1: Integrate SQLite with Flask Application

Modify the Flask application (app.py) to use SQLite as the database.

### Step 2: Build and Run the Application Tier Container

Follow the steps from Part 2 to build and run the application tier container. The SQLite database will be managed within this container.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have successfully set up a three-tier application using Docker. The presentation tier serves a webpage with information fetched from the application tier, which interacts with a SQLite database. This architecture provides scalability, flexibility, and isolation for each tier, making it suitable for various web applications.
